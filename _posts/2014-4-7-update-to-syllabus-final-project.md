Dear Students,

After reviewing the syllabus, we are going to defer the deadline for your final projects until 4/28. This is an optional extension,  you are still welcome to turn in your final paper on 4/21. For those who would like extra time to revise based on the feedback from your oral presentations are welcome to turn in their paper on 4/28. It should be turned in paper form to Dr. Michelson and via OAK in electronic form.

Best,
DM
