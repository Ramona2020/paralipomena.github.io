Just a brief follow up note regarding our class and adjusting the schedule due to missing the first week.

We are keen to make sure that no one gets lost as we all get up to speed on xml, so we have adjusted the syllabus in the following ways:

(Please refer to the online [syllabus](http://paralipomena.com/schedule/) since the paper version is now out of date):

* Please do attempt exercises 0-3 and 6 from TEI by Example BUT if you find that they are beyond your ability, don't despair. We will set aside extra time in class on Monday Jan 27 to work through them.
* Please do the reading by Moretti either in the book or if you are unable to purchase the book through the following list of [online essays](http://paralipomena.com/blog/2014/01/14/distant-reading.html).
* Do NOT prepare a response paper on xml databases (we have moved this to February 3rd to give us more time to learn xml).
* Instead, we would encourage you to write a short response paper as a review of Moretti's book or essays, if you do choose to do that to meet your response paper requirements please bring a copy to class on Jan 27.

In short, please don't let the newness of learning xml discourage you, we will have time to work through it together in class on the 27th.

Best,
DM
