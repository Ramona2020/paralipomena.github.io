A reminder that [Todd F. Hughes](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/csls/thughes.php), Director of Instructional Technology at the
[Center for Second Language Studies](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/csls/index.php), will be holding a TEI workshop from 3:00 to 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, January 21st. This workshop is entirely optional. However, it provides a good opportunity to work through the [TEI by Example](http://www.teibyexample.org/) exercises assigned for this week in a group environment.
