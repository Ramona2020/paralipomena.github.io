Just a bit of help as you work on finding your XML or TEI repositories for next week. (Please remember that you are to write a required response paper in which you identify and review an XML based digital humanities project relevant to your research or vocational interests.)

First you might want to look at the data we have collected here (and trace it back to its source): [https://github.com/paralipomena](https://github.com/paralipomena)

Next you should look over these list of links:

* [TEI Wiki](http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Samples)
* [TEI Council](http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Projects/)
* ["Projects Using TEI for MS Description," a list begun by Dr. Michelson's research team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wv5Xn4aUW8uNUv1c-B5KNyzRx_TmWOKYEZylv5znPzc/edit)

You could also search the index of:

* [The Journal of the TEI](http://journal.tei-c.org/journal/index)

You could also search the archives of a mailing list and or join and ask about projects relevant to your interests:

* [TEI-L](http://www.tei-c.org/Support/index.xml#tei-l)
* [MARKUP List](http://lsv.uky.edu/scripts/wa.exe?SUBED1=markup&A=1)
