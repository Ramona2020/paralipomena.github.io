<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The course provides an introduction to the theory and methods of the digital humanities
    with particular attention to the disciplinary perspectives of history and religious
    studies. This course is designed for graduate students of history, religion, literature,
    historical theology or classics who would like to acquire research skills in the
    techniques of digital text editing and analysis. Students will learn the fundamentals of
    digital text editing and the computational analysis of digital corpora. Students will
    engage with theoretical questions concerning the nature of texts and the challenges of
    representing the past through new media. By the conclusion of the course, students will
    have crafted a future research plan specific their for digital editing and/or analysis
    needs.</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The application of new media and information technology to interpretive questions in the
    humanities holds significant promise for future research in the historical study of
    religion. Although the field of “digital humanities” is perhaps not well known within
    the discipline of religious studies, historians of religion can boast of a prominent
    role in its development. For example, Fr. Roberto Busa (1913-2011) is widely considered
    to a founder of “humanities computing” in the United States through his pioneering work
    to encode the <em>Index Thomisticus</em> using IBM punch cards over a period of two
    decades (from the 1940-60s). Since Busa’s time, a large variety of digital corpora have
    now been created which are of interest for the historical study of religion. These
    collections range from vast electronic corpus of ancient literature, and from
    comparative editions of medieval and early modern manuscripts to the collected works of
    twentieth-century authors.</p>
<p>The creation of these digital collections of texts bring with them a variety of
    accompanying questions worthy of scholarly reflection. How does access to such digital
    corpora alter existing patterns of scholarly research? What impact will “distant
    reading” (Franco Moretti) of electronic corpora have on the study of history and
    religion? What assumptions are implicit in the encoding of texts? How can scholars
    effectively pursue lines of interest computationally across hundred, thousands or
    potentially millions of documents?</p>
<p>This course offers students an opportunity to directly reflect on these questions as they
    explore potential applications of digital technology to their research in history,
    religion, theology or classics. Specifically, this course will cover three broad themes.
    First, we will seek to introduce “digital humanities” and investigate the theoretical
    and methodological issues in applying technology to humanistic research, including
    identifying the limits and epistemological constraints of technology. Second, we will
    survey current digital humanities research with an aim to identifying emerging trends,
    successful models, design values, and potential pitfalls. Lastly, over the course,
    students will develop a specific plan for implementing a digital element into their own
    research. In preparation, students will have the opportunity to learn new technical
    skills and tools.</p>
<h1>Student Leaning Outcomes</h1>
<ol>
    <li>All students will acquire an introductory knowledge of the interdisciplinary field
        of digital humanities sufficient to engage current methodological questions, such
        as: What is the relationship between a &quot;text&quot; and &quot;data&quot;? What
        is the relation between close reading and “distant reading”? How is digital text
        editing transforming the practice of scholarly editing? How do statistical analysis
        and computational techniques supplement established modes of humanistic
        inquiry?</li>
    <li>All students will acquire a basic knowledge of Extensible Markup Language (XML)
        sufficient to interpret and analyze humanistic texts encoded in XML formats.</li>
    <li>As applicable, all students will become familiar with existing documentary XML
        datasets relevant to their specific research interests.</li>
    <li>All students will acquire a basic knowledge of the XQuery programming language
        sufficient for a theoretical understanding of how to analyze, transform, and query
        XML documents.</li>

        href="http://oxygenxml.com/buy_academic_edition.html">oXygen XML Editor</a>, a
    cross-platform software which can be purchased with an academic license. Students should
        <em>NOT</em> purchase this software until after a consultation with the
    instructors.</p>
<h1>Assessments</h1>
<p>Students will be assisted in assessing their learning through completion of the following
    assignments:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Formative Assessments</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Technical Exercises (ungraded, optional, due date varies)</p>
                <p>Students will have the opportunity to periodically complete coding
                    exercises and tutorials to practice the techniques discussed in
                    class.</p></li>
            <li><p>Response Papers (each 10% of final grade, due date varies)</p>
                <p>Students will be asked to write five response papers (or approximately
                    750-1000 words each) over the course of the semester on topics of their
                    choosing. These papers may take a variety of formats (with
                    instructors&#39; approval) including reviews of digital humanities
                    projects, reviews of relevant literature, and methodological responses
                    to topics of interest.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>Summative Assessments</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Future Implementation Plan (10% of final grade, due 4/28)</p>
                <p>At the end of the semester, each student will compose a 1500-word
                    statement detailing how they will integrate what they have learned in
                    this course into their future academic or vocational development. This
                    implementation plan should include a discussion of both short term steps
                    and longer-term goals. It may take the form of an evaluative reflection
                    on the student&#39;s final project (see below).</p></li>
            <li><p>Final Project (30% of final grade, due 4/21)</p>
                <p>Each student will create a final project of their own design with
                    supervision from the instructors. This final project should be relevant
                    to the student&#39;s future academic or vocational plans. It may take
                    the form of a computational analysis of existing datasets, the encoding
                    of data (or composition of guidelines for authoring data), a critical
                    essay reflecting on the digital humanities, or an other format approved
                    by the instructors. In all cases, the final project must be accompanied
                    by an interpretive write-up of approximately 4,000-8,000 words.</p></li>
            <li><p>Public Presentation and Participation (10% of final grade, due 4/21)</p>
                <p>Each student will give a short public presentation at the end of the
                    semester on their final project. (These will be held on April 21st
                    during our regular meeting time.) This presentation will be assessed by
                    the instructors together with the student&#39;s seminar participation
                    from across the semester. Students who have made a discernible
                    contribution to fostering intellectual community and dialogue will
                    receive full credit for participation.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>Grading</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system">Vanderbilt
        Honor Code</a> applies to all work in this course.</p>
<p>Final grades will be calculated along the following percentage scale:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A = 90 to 100</li>
    <li>B+ = 85 to &lt;90</li>
    <li>B = 80 to &lt;85</li>
    <li>C = 70 to &lt;80</li>
    <li>D = 60 to &lt;70</li>
    <li>F = &lt;60</li>
</ul>
<p>Assignments will be graded using letter designations (described below) and then converted
    to the top range of the scale above (A=100 B+=89, etc.). </p>
<p>For the evaluation of your work, we will use our own remix of standards originally
    formulated by <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/history/undergraduate/grading_practices"
        >Princeton University</a>: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>&quot;A&quot;-level writing or research is good enough to be read aloud or
            presented in a seminar. It is clearly written or presented and well-organized.
            It demonstrates that the student has acquired the intellectual skills taught in
            the course, conducted a close and critical reading of texts, grappled with the
            issues raised in the course, synthesized the readings, discussions, and
            lectures, and/or formulated a perceptive, compelling, independent argument. The
            assignment shows intellectual originality and creativity, is sensitive to
            historical context, and, in the case of a research paper, is built on a critical
            reading of primary material.</p></li>
    <li><p>&quot;B or B+&quot;-level writing or research demonstrates many aspects of
            A-level work but falls short of it in either the organization and clarity, the
            formulation and presentation of its argument, or the quality of research. Some
            papers or projects in this category are solid works containing flashes of
            insight into many of the issues raised in the course. Others give evidence of
            independent thought, but they are not presented clearly or
        convincingly.</p></li>
    <li><p>&quot;C&quot;-level writing or research offers little more than an inadequate
            reiteration of ideas and information covered in the course, is insensitive to
            historical context, does not respond to the assignment adequately, suffers from
            frequent factual errors, unclear writing, poor organization, or inadequate
            primary research, or presents some combination of these problems.</p></li>
    <li><p>&quot;D&quot;-level writing or research demonstrates serious deficiencies or
            severe flaws in the student&#39;s command of course or research
        material.</p></li>
    <li><p>&quot;F&quot;-level writing or research demonstrates no competence in the course
            or research materials. It indicates a student&#39;s neglect or lack of effort in
            the course.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Attendance &amp; Participation</h1>
<p>Attendance and active participation are essential parts of the course. Students who miss
    more than 4 class sessions without the instructors&#39; permission will automatically
    fail the course.</p>
<h1>Accommodation</h1>
<p>All students are encouraged to meet with the instructors to discuss any needs related to
    the course! Students needing accommodation through the Disability Services Program (DSP)
    are encouraged to register with the EAD office (615-322-4705) first and then meet with
    the professors to arrange for accommodations. </p>
<h1>Diversity, Humility, Respect</h1>
<p>We hope that you will join us in finding one of the joys of this course to be the fact
    that we will consider a diverse array of approaches to understanding human culture. Both
    students and instructors will be encouraged to adopt a stance of intellectual humility
    and mutual respect as we engage with each other and the voices of those we study.</p>
